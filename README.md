## Project Overview

Bullet Last brings together cutting-edge technologies to deliver a unique gaming experience. The key components of the project include:

- **Unity**: Utilized for the game's development, Unity provides a robust and versatile platform for creating immersive 3D environments.

- **Blender**: The game features intricately designed characters and 3D models created using Blender, a powerful open-source 3D content creation suite. Blender was used to generate an impressive array of **10,000 unique NFT characters**.

- **JavaScript**: Scripting in JavaScript is employed to establish a connection between Unity and the Ethereum blockchain. These scripts, read by Unity, enable seamless integration with blockchain functionalities.

- **Photon**: For multiplayer functionality, Photon is integrated to manage the intense battles within the game, ensuring a smooth and engaging multiplayer experience.


## Game in Unity

In the Unity game environment, Bullet Last communicates with the blockchain to determine which NFTs a player owns in their wallet. It then reads the metadata of the NFT and creates a in-game character with the exact characteristics of the NFT, allowing players to immerse themselves in the game with their own unique NFT.

### Real-Time Multiplayer with Photon

Bullet Last utilizes Photon for real-time multiplayer battles. Players can engage in intense battles with each other, with the last surviving player claiming the accumulated pot of tokens.
